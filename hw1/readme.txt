Homework1 of GAMES201 online course, implemented a variety of different implicit/explicit time integrators.

Explicit: explicit euler/semi-implicit euler/midpoint method/Runge-Kutta method. Details see in mass-spring/explicit
Implicit: Jacobi/Gauss-Seidel/conjugate gradients iterative methods for backward Euler. Details see in mass-spring/implicit

mass-spring/mass_spring_framework.py is a framework of every single method, support GUI, general methods and data.
mass-spring/implicit/implicit_utility.py is use to solve A and b, which in the equation of Ax = b.
